# DER-SSL: Dark Experience Replay with Self-Supervised Learning
*Abstract: Although many continual learning approaches claim to be state-of-the-art, they often do it by defining their own specific setting/evaluation. In this work, we tackle the \textit{class incremental learning} setting, the most difficult and general continual learning setting. We start with Dark Experience Replay (DER), a simple and strong baseline. We extend it to do Self-Supervised Learning to mitigate a common problem in Class-IL known as Prior Information Loss (PIL). We plan to submit our approach to a competition instantiated in Sequoia, a framework which organizes the continual learning research problems to better compare methods with each other.*
